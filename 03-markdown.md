## What is Markdown?

- Plain text format
- Easy to write by humans
- Easy to read even with a simple text editor (*readability*)
- Optionally convert to other formats (e.g. HTML, PDF)
- Inline HTML (including SVG) is possible in many cases
- Heavily used by GitHub for e.g. issues, comments, *readme*-files, etc.
